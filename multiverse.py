    Manages multiple parallel timelines created by player choices.

    ARCHITECTURAL NOTE: This is a non-trivial system. A naive implementation that
    deep-copies the entire WorldState for each fork is computationally infeasible.
    A production-ready solution would require one of the following strategies:

    1. Copy-on-Write (CoW): Chunks are shared between timelines by reference. When a block
       is changed in one timeline, only the affected chunk is copied and modified. This
       saves memory but adds complexity to chunk management.

    2. Delta State Tracking: The 'main' timeline is the source of truth. Other timelines
       only store a list of differences (deltas) from the main timeline. This is memory
       efficient for small changes but can be slow to reconstruct world state, as you
       have to apply all deltas.
