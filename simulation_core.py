    the interactions BETWEEN layers. For example:
    - How does a 'classical' player interact with a 'quantum' field?
    - How does a large number of 'molecular' objects aggregate to form a 'classical' one?
    - Event handlers and message passing systems are needed to communicate forces and
      state changes across these boundaries. A simple update loop is insufficient.
